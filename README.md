<h1><u>Introducing Unstructured Parser.......</u></h1>


Unstructured data parsing refers to the process of extracting meaningful information from data that lacks a predefined format or organization. This type of data can include text documents, social media posts, images, and videos, which comprise a significant portion of the information generated todayâ€”estimated at 80% to 90% of all data collected by organizations
The Parsing Process
The parsing process typically involves several steps:

    Data Input: Raw unstructured data is fed into a parser, which can be a software tool or program designed to interpret various data formats.
    Data Breakdown: The parser analyzes the data and breaks it down into smaller, manageable components. This may involve identifying key entities, such as names, dates, or locations, and extracting them from the larger dataset

.
Data Structuring: The extracted information is then organized into a structured format, such as tables or databases, making it easier for further analysis or integration with other data systems
.
Validation and Transformation: During parsing, the data may undergo validation checks to ensure accuracy and may be transformed into different formats as needed (e.g., converting dates from strings to date objects)
.

You will need:

    A compatible source (input) location in cloud storage that contains your documents for Unstructured to process. See the list of supported source types.
    Compatible files in your source location. See the list of supported file types. If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the example-docs folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub.
    A compatible destination (output) location in cloud storage for Unstructured to put the processed data. See the list of supported destination types.
